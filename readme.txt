Every WordPress security plugin becomes more complicated and bloated as more features are added. As a plugin's code grows, it consumes more time to load, thus slowing down your website. WP Security Safe's purpose is to protect your website from the majority of threats with minimal impact on website load time. We constantly test our load performance to ensure our features to ensure it continues to run fast and lean.
